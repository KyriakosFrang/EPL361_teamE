      <p>For this game no knowledge of the previous part of the game</p>
      <p>is needed.All you need to know is some necessary </p>
      <p>knowledge in Geography.</p>
      <p>This game consists of two smaller games. In one game you</p>
      <p> are asked to match the name of any country or the sound of </p>
      <p>its name that is in English with the flag of the country. In </p>
      <p>the other game you can see the map of Europe where you </p>
      <p>are asked to match the name of each country with the </p>
      <p>country's position on the map.      </p>
      <p>		These two games change randomly so you don't have to</p>
      <p> complete one of the games in order to play the other but</p>
      <p> you can play both games.      </p>
      <p>In this game too you have at your disposal three lives. </p>
      <p>That is to say the game ends when you have totaled three </p>
      <p>wrong attempts at any level of the game.	The 'unpress'</p>
      <p> button is to cancel your current choice and make a new one. </p>
<p><strong>Points Calculation:</strong></p>
        <p>Correct answer: 10 Points </p>
        <p>Incorrect answer: -10 Points </p>
